The previous AI engineer successfully built the core Meu Look IA application from scratch, addressing numerous user requests and debugging critical issues. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with basic setup and progressively adding features and refining the UI/UX. Key milestones included setting up the Expo frontend and FastAPI backend, implementing user authentication, and creating core screens for clothing upload, wardrobe management, and look generation.

Significant effort was dedicated to image handling, initially fixing issues where profile and clothing photos were not displayed correctly (due to incorrect usage of base64). A major feature, virtual try-on, was implemented using Fal.ai FASHN API, which required extensive debugging related to API key configuration, handling exhausted balance errors, addressing failed to detect body pose issues (due to synthetic images), and correcting the extraction of the generated image URL from the API response. UI/UX was enhanced by replacing all  calls with a custom, globally accessible modal component, improving text input fields, adding a loading indicator for the AI try-on process, and implementing full-screen image viewing with visual cues. The text-based AI suggestions were also refined to prevent raw JSON output, ensuring a natural, formatted user experience. The current task involves adding social sharing functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application aims to help users organize clothes and receive AI-driven outfit suggestions. Users can upload photos of clothes, footwear, and accessories, along with a full-body photo. The app's AI capabilities include:
1.  Background removal from clothing items (currently not implemented, uses original image).
2.  Virtual try-on: showing the user wearing different combinations using their own body photo and uploaded clothes, powered by external AI (Fal.ai FASHN).
3.  Automatic look suggestions based on weather, occasion, and personal preferences, using a text-based AI (OpenAI GPT via Emergent LLM key).

Key functionalities implemented so far:
-   User authentication (login, registration).
-   Upload of clothes, footwear, accessories (saves base64 images).
-   Upload of user's full-body photo (saves base64 image).
-   Try-on virtual via Fal.ai FASHN API, displaying generated images of user wearing selected clothes.
-   Automated look suggestions using OpenAI GPT, formatted for better readability.
-   Display of user's wardrobe with clothing thumbnails.
-   Modal system to replace all native alerts for consistent UI.
-   Full-screen view for generated try-on images.
-   Loading indicator for AI-driven processes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on adding social sharing functionality to the Gerar Look screen (). Specifically, the task is to include buttons for sharing the generated try-on images on WhatsApp and Instagram. The initial step for this task has been completed, which involved installing the necessary Expo dependencies:  and . The next steps would involve implementing the actual sharing functions using these libraries and then adding the UI buttons to the  file. The goal is to allow users to easily share their AI-generated outfits directly from the app.
