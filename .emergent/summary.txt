<analysis>
The AI engineer's work during this trajectory involved extensive application debugging and feature enhancements. Initially, the focus shifted from a prior analysis (Node.js/Gradle/Kotlin/Expo SDK build fixes, landing page, splash screen, CORS) to a user request to re-clone and compile a new repository, signifying a new baseline. Key technical challenges included resolving a frontend Stripe integration issue on the web due to incorrect platform-specific imports and  exports, which was fixed by adjusting  and  and clearing Metro cache. Backend issues primarily involved Fal.ai API key authentication (401 error), followed by  errors due to incorrect clothing categories, both resolved by user-provided keys and mapping logic in . Security was addressed by moving the Stripe publishable key from hardcoded frontend usage to a dynamic fetch from a new backend endpoint. UI/UX improvements included fixing native camera behavior (adding confirmation for crop) in  and , implementing  for input screens (, , partially ), and generating custom app icons. The current work involves modifying the  screen to display suggested outfit images rather than just text, with a magnification feature.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application aims to help users organize clothes and generate AI-driven outfit suggestions using uploaded photos, Fal.ai for virtual try-on, and OpenAI GPT for text. Core features include custom modals, full-screen image viewing, loading indicators, and social sharing. Users receive 5 free try-ons, then subscribe via Stripe.

Previous development iterations focused on implementing premium subscription features (Stripe payment flows, recurring subscriptions, plan management), password reset (SendGrid), improved authentication, and Fal.ai try-ons for multiple items.

During this specific trajectory, the user explicitly requested:
1.  **Clone and Compile:** Re-clone the project from a new GitHub repository and compile it as-is without updating libraries, assuming prior build issues (Node.js engine, Kotlin, Gradle, , React/Expo SDK compatibility) were resolved externally.
2.  **Fal.ai API Fix:** Resolve errors with the Fal.ai API during look generation, specifically related to authentication and clothing categorization.
3.  **Stripe Key Security:** Transfer the Stripe publishable key from hardcoded frontend code to a secure backend endpoint.
4.  **Native Camera UX:** Fix the native camera interface for photo uploads (clothes and body) to include a confirmation button after cropping.
5.  **Keyboard Handling:** Ensure native inputs are not covered by the keyboard, implementing .
6.  **Custom App Icons:** Create and configure custom app icons for the native application.
7.  **Fal.ai Clothing Type Specification:** Enhance Fal.ai API calls to accurately specify clothing types (e.g., shoe, blouse).
8.  **Native Body Photo Area:** Adjust the native camera capture area for full-body photos to be larger.
9.  **Generate Look Visuals:** Modify the generate look screen to display suggested *images* of clothes instead of just text, with a magnification option.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to enhance the generate look screen. Currently, the screen displays only text descriptions of suggested outfits. The user explicitly requested that the screen should instead show the *images* of the suggested clothes, along with an option to magnify or enlarge these images for better viewing.

The AI engineer has begun this task by investigating the  file. It has confirmed the presence of a  state, indicating existing functionality for image amplification. The next step in the process is to modify the Suggested Clothes section within  to display actual images of the recommended outfits, utilizing and integrating with the existing image amplification mechanism. This involves altering the JSX structure to render  components instead of  for clothing items and connecting them to the full-screen image viewing logic.
