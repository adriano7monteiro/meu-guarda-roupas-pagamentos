<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on Meu Look IA primarily focused on enhancing core features and addressing critical bugs to move the application towards a production-ready state. Initial tasks involved refining the subscription and payment flows: fixing an incorrect display of monthly plan price (R/bin/bash.01 instead of R.00 due to frontend division by 100), implementing a redirect to the home screen post-payment, and upgrading Stripe integration from single  to recurring  payments. A significant portion of this involved extensive debugging of Stripe-related errors ( deprecation,  issues, and  retrieval from incomplete invoices), leading to robust error handling and manual PaymentIntent creation when needed.

Beyond payments, the AI engineer integrated a comprehensive password reset system using SendGrid, including backend endpoints, a new frontend screen, and debugging SendGrid's email delivery and frontend modal display issues. The authentication flow was also improved by removing demo data options and allowing direct input in registration fields. Finally, the AI enhanced the Fal.ai virtual try-on API integration to support sequential application of up to three clothing items. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting a landing page, which the AI has just begun.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application assists users in organizing clothes and generating AI-driven outfit suggestions by uploading clothing and full-body photos, using Fal.ai FASHN API for virtual try-on, and OpenAI GPT for text suggestions. It features custom modals, full-screen image viewing, loading indicators, and social sharing. Users get 5 free try-ons, then subscribe via Stripe.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **Subscription Display:** Visibly mark active plans on the home screen, showing name, looks used, and renewal date. (Implemented with a Premium Card).
2.  **Stripe Payment Flow:** Correctly process payments, redirect to home screen after confirmation, and ensure recurring subscriptions are properly set up via Stripe, not single Payment Intents. This included extensive debugging to handle various Stripe API response nuances and error conditions.
3.  **Plan Management:** Allow users to cancel their active subscription plan from within the app, specifically via an icon on the home screen card leading to a cancellation option.
4.  **Authentication & User Management:** Implement a Forgot Password mechanism with email-based recovery (SendGrid), remove demo login options to facilitate new user registration, and enable direct input fields on registration.
5.  **AI Try-on Enhancement:** Allow the Fal.ai FASHN API to apply multiple clothing items (up to 3) sequentially onto the user's body photo for more complex outfit suggestions.
6.  **Landing Page:** Create a separate landing page to promote the application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the user requested to create a landing page to promote the application. The AI engineer acknowledged this request and initiated the first step, which is to create a separate folder to house the content of this new landing page. This indicates the beginning of a new feature development phase, transitioning from internal application enhancements to external marketing and outreach. The process is currently at the very initial stage of directory structuring for the new landing page, with no content or code implemented yet.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will proceed with creating the necessary files and initial content for the landing page within the new folder.
