The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on a React Native (Expo) and FastAPI application. Initially, the AI cloned the user's project, leading to confusion due to a pre-existing web project in the workspace. This was clarified, and the user's project was moved to the root. The AI then addressed persistent issues with environment variables in AAB builds for Expo, specifically by introducing  and a centralized API configuration. Concurrently, it implemented a comprehensive Google Play recurring subscription system on the backend, including database model updates, new API endpoints, and a subscription checking script. Finally, the AI developed and integrated a privacy policy page for the landing page and created interactive HTML tools for generating app store graphics, resolving a CORS issue in the process. The current work focuses on refactoring the frontend to use the new environment variable access pattern.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary goal was to enhance an existing application, , which is a React Native (Expo) frontend with a FastAPI backend.
Key requirements included:
1.  **Environment Variable Fixes**: Resolve an issue where  was not being correctly picked up from  during AAB builds for Google Play publication. This involved understanding Expo's environment variable handling.
2.  **Google Play Recurring Subscriptions**: Implement a complete recurring subscription system via Google Play, replacing a previous Stripe integration (while preserving Stripe endpoints). This necessitated backend modifications to handle purchase verification, webhooks, and subscription status checks.
3.  **Privacy Policy Page**: Create a static privacy policy page within the  directory and ensure it's properly linked from the main landing page, including in prominent sections like the footer, Call-to-Action (CTA), and hero section.
4.  **App Store Graphics Generation**: Provide tools or generate specific graphic assets for Google Play Store listing:
    *   An app icon (512x512px).
    *   A feature graphic (1024x500px).
    *   Optimized screenshots conforming to Google Play specifications (PNG/JPEG, 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio, 320-3840px sides, up to 8MB).
</product_requirements>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the persistent issue of environment variables not being correctly picked up during Expo AAB builds. The root cause was identified as inconsistent access methods for  in the frontend (using  instead of a method compatible with  injection via ).

To solve this, the AI:
1.  **Created **: This file dynamically configures the Expo app, ensuring that variables defined in  are exposed via .
2.  **Created **: This utility file provides a single, consistent entry point () for the frontend to access the backend URL, retrieving it from .
3.  **Initiated Frontend Refactoring**: The AI is currently iterating through various frontend  files to replace all instances of  with the newly imported  from . This ensures that the backend URL is always sourced correctly, especially during AAB builds.

The last action recorded was the AI stating: Agora vou adicionar os imports nos arquivos restantes. Deixe-me continuar com um script mais eficiente: indicating it is actively continuing this refactoring process across the remaining frontend files. The AI has already made edits to , , and is progressing through other files like , , etc.
