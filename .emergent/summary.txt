The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's work on the Meu Look IA application, starting with a user request to display the active subscription plan on the home screen. The AI proposed and implemented a Premium Card showing plan details and dynamically changing the Assinar Premium button to Gerenciar Plano. This involved developing new backend endpoints to fetch subscription status and updating the frontend () to display this information and handle its fetching lifecycle.

A significant portion of the work involved debugging issues. Initially, the premium card wasn't displaying correctly due to  timing and token availability on the frontend. Later, a critical bug emerged where Stripe payments were debited but not confirmed in the app, leading to deep dives into the  and  endpoints and Stripe PaymentIntent status. The work culminated in debugging a JSON Parse Error during login, which required adding robust error handling and content-type validation to the frontend's authentication logic (). The AI verified backend URLs were correct and asked the user to re-test with improved logging.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application aims to assist users in organizing clothes and generating AI-driven outfit suggestions. Key features include uploading clothing and full-body photos, virtual try-on via Fal.ai FASHN API, and text-based outfit suggestions using OpenAI GPT. The application uses custom modals for consistent UI/UX, allows full-screen image viewing, provides loading indicators, and enables social sharing of generated looks.

A core component is the subscription model: users receive 5 free virtual try-ons, after which paid plans (monthly, semiannual, annual) are available via Stripe Payment Sheet. Plan details are dynamically fetched from the backend. The application also displays saved looks with images and offers a free-text input for AI suggestion context. The most recent explicit request from the user was to visibly mark the active subscription plan on the home screen once a user has paid and their plan is active, including showing plan name, looks used, and renewal date.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively debugging a JSON Parse Error that occurred during the user's login attempt. This error manifested on the frontend, even though backend logs indicated a successful (200 OK) response for the login API call.

The AI engineer's investigation focused on the  file, specifically the  function responsible for making the login request and processing its response. The core issue was identified as the frontend attempting to parse the server's response as JSON () without validating that the  header indicated a JSON response, leading to a parse error if the response was not valid JSON.

To address this, the AI engineer modified  to:
1.  Add detailed  statements for both the login request and the server's response (status and body).
2.  Implement a check for the  header () before attempting .
3.  Include specific error handling for cases where JSON parsing fails, providing clearer error messages.

After applying these changes and restarting the frontend, the AI engineer verified that the backend URLs were correctly configured and accessible. The current state is that the frontend has improved logging for login requests, and the user has been asked to re-attempt login to capture these new, more diagnostic logs for further investigation.

Request the user to attempt login again to capture detailed browser console logs from the enhanced frontend error handling.
