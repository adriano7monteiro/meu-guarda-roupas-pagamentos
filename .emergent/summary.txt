The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Meu Look IA application, beginning with fixing a reported regression where virtual try-on () stopped working. This led to extensive debugging of the Fal.ai API key, including correcting the  header format ( vs. ) and ensuring a valid key was used. After resolving the Fal.ai integration, the AI engineer implemented a comprehensive Stripe-based subscription system, including a free tier (5 looks), dynamic plan fetching from the backend, and integrating Stripe's Payment Sheet for transparent checkout. This involved significant backend API development (user model updates, subscription endpoints, look counter) and frontend UI/UX work (subscription screen, premium button, upgrade modal, platform-specific Stripe rendering). Concurrently, several bug fixes and enhancements were made: displaying images in saved looks, ensuring AI suggestions use valid clothing IDs, enabling the Salvar Look button only after virtual try-on, and adding a free-text context field for AI suggestions. The persistent topFocus error with Stripe React Native on the web preview necessitated a platform-specific component strategy. The trajectory concludes with ongoing efforts to resolve the  error and the creation of  documentation due to gitignore issues.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application helps users organize clothes and receive AI-driven outfit suggestions. It supports uploading clothing and a full-body photo. The core AI features include background removal (postponed), virtual try-on via Fal.ai FASHN API, and text-based outfit suggestions powered by OpenAI GPT.

Implemented functionalities encompass:
- User authentication and profile management.
- Upload/display of clothing items and user's full-body photo.
- Virtual try-on () displaying AI-generated images.
- Automated text-based look suggestions, formatted for readability.
- A custom modal system replacing native alerts for consistent UI/UX.
- Full-screen viewing for generated try-on images.
- Loading indicators for AI processes.
- Social sharing functionality for generated looks (WhatsApp, Instagram).
- A subscription model allowing 5 free virtual try-ons, followed by paid plans (monthly R9.90, semiannual R9.00, annual R79.90) with Stripe Payment Sheet for transparent checkout.
- Dynamic fetching of subscription plan details from the backend.
- Display of saved looks with their corresponding images, viewable in full-screen.
- A free-text input field on the look generation screen to provide additional context to the AI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent topFocus error that occurred when loading the application, specifically related to the  library on the web preview. Despite previous attempts to use conditional rendering and platform-specific  files (, ) which allowed the web preview to initially load, the user reported the topFocus error reappearing upon app load in the web environment.

The AI engineer identified that even with conditional imports, the Metro bundler was still attempting to process native-only Stripe modules, causing the crash. The last recorded action (Chat Message 615) indicates a plan to try a different approach: remover completamente o Stripe do arquivo e apenas mostrar mensagem informativa. This suggests a temporary removal of the Stripe integration from the web-facing component to ensure the app loads, while preserving it for native platforms. This is a critical debugging step to isolate the issue and provide a functional web experience, even if the Stripe payment functionality is not available there.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to remove Stripe components from the  file for web platforms and display an informative message instead.
