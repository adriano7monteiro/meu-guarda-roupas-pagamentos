The AI engineer's trajectory involved substantial feature development and bug fixes for the Meu Look IA application. Initial work centered on enhancing the generate look screen to display outfit images with magnification, rectifying a backend data field (), and applying necessary frontend styles. User requests further guided the removal of the virtual try-on feature on the generate look screen, replacing it with a save look option, and streamlining associated UI and logic. Lazy loading was implemented for both Meu Guarda-Roupas and Looks Salvos screens, entailing backend pagination and frontend  integration, while also resolving a duplicate key issue. New clothing types were integrated, and an image amplification feature was added to Meu Guarda-Roupas.

Crucially, the home screen was updated to fetch and display dynamic user statistics (clothes, looks, favorites), correcting previous hardcoded values. A Send Suggestion feature was developed, encompassing a backend endpoint, MongoDB storage, and email notification via SendGrid. The category carousel on Looks Salvos became horizontally scrollable, Stripe payment forms were localized to Portuguese, and native app icon build issues were resolved through  updates and a comprehensive guide. Production deployment concerns were a major focus: AI costs and payment for GPT-4o-mini were detailed, and migration from the proprietary  to a direct OpenAI API key was facilitated. Backend health/status endpoints were implemented, and a critical  hardcoding flaw was addressed. Heroku deployment issues (H14) were fixed via  and , and a strong  was generated. The trajectory concluded with detailed debugging of the statistics feature on external hosting, confirming backend functionality and pinpointing frontend APK's  or authentication as the likely remaining issue, immediately followed by logging in with a user possessing data to re-test the statistics.

<product_requirements>
The Meu Look IA application aims to empower users in organizing their wardrobe and receiving AI-driven outfit suggestions. It leverages Fal.ai for virtual try-ons (though this was partially removed in this trajectory) and OpenAI GPT for textual recommendations. Key functionalities include custom modals, full-screen image viewing, and a subscription model via Stripe for premium features.

During this trajectory, the explicit requests and implementations were:
1.  **Generate Look Visuals:** Display suggested outfit images on the generate look screen with a magnification option, instead of just text.
2.  **Remove Virtual Try-on:** Replace the Ver em Mim (virtual try-on) functionality on the generate look screen with a Salvar Look (save look) button.
3.  **Saved Looks Carousel:** Implement an image carousel for clothes in saved looks, with an amplification feature.
4.  **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for clothing items on Meu Guarda-Roupas and Looks Salvos screens.
5.  **Clothing Type Expansion:** Add new clothing types (Saia, Camisa, Blusinha, Cropped, Shorts) for uploads and filtering.
6.  **Home Screen Statistics:** Display actual user statistics (total clothes, total looks, total favorites) on the home screen, fetching data dynamically.
7.  **Image Amplification in My Wardrobe:** Add a feature to magnify images of clothes on the Meu Guarda-Roupas screen.
8.  **Suggestions Card:** Implement a card on the home screen for users to submit improvement suggestions, saving them to MongoDB and sending an email.
9.  **Stripe Form Localization:** Translate the Stripe payment form to Portuguese on the subscription screen.
10. **Native App Icon Fix:** Resolve issues with custom app icons not appearing correctly in native APK builds.
11. **OpenAI Direct Integration:** Migrate from  to direct OpenAI API key usage in the backend.
12. **Backend Health Endpoints:** Create  and  endpoints for monitoring backend service health.
13. **JWT_SECRET Security:** Move  from hardcoded value to an environment variable.
14. **Heroku Deployment Fixes:** Address Heroku H14 errors by providing  and .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in debugging the Suas Estatísticas (Your Statistics) functionality on the home screen () for a user's externally hosted backend. The user had reported that statistics were not loading, despite all other functionalities working. The AI engineer had performed extensive debugging steps:
1.  **Backend Verification:** Confirmed the backend on the user's Heroku hosting was healthy and connected to MongoDB, and that backend endpoints for fetching clothes, looks, and favorite counts (, , ) were returning correct data structures (though possibly empty counts if no data).
2.  **Frontend Logic Debugging:** Added detailed  statements within the  function in  to trace responses from the backend and identify any failing  checks or data parsing issues.
3.  **Frontend Simulation:** Explicitly simulated the  frontend logic, confirming that it correctly processes valid backend responses to update the  state.
4.  **User Authentication & Data:** The AI had just successfully logged in with a specific user () who was known to have registered clothes.

The current state is that the backend API endpoints for statistics are confirmed to be working correctly on the user's hosting. The frontend logic to process these responses is also believed to be correct. The prime suspicion for the statistics not displaying remains an incorrect  configured in the user's deployed frontend APK, or an invalid/expired authentication token being used by the frontend app itself. The AI is poised to re-test the statistics display in the frontend using the newly logged-in user's context.

<optional_next_step>
Test the statistics feature on the home screen using the provided user credentials to verify if the statistics now load correctly with actual user data.
